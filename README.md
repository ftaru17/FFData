# FFData - another DATA-MINING project for save file formats and gameplay data for Final Fantasy games

[*.map]: savefile (and memory) format\
-- just write the simplest parser for your programming language (ignore the parts from 3rd "|")

   
[*.db]: SQLite DB with in-game data lists, dictionaries, enumeration\
-- extract the required data into your program's data format

**[NFFXSS - Final Fantasy {xxx} Spoiler Server](https://www.moddb.com/mods/nffxss-final-fantasy-xx-2-spoiler-server)** - my own tool for monitoring game process memory, viewing game data (and cheating some values) - in fact, these files are collected on its basis\
(the source code will be published after the beta version is completed.)
